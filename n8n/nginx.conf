# Nginx Websocket Configuration Explained
# Your nginx configuration is correctly handling websocket connections with the settings you have. Let's break down each directive and explain what it does:

# Basic Proxy Settings

# proxy_pass http://n8n:5678;
# Routes all requests to the n8n service at internal hostname n8n on port 5678

# proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
# Passes the client's real IP address to n8n
# Helps n8n know where requests are coming from despite being behind a proxy

# proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
# Tells n8n whether the original request came via HTTP or HTTPS
# Important for n8n to generate correct URLs in its responses

# proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
# Preserves the original Host header from the client request
# Ensures n8n knows which hostname was used to access it


# Websocket-Specific Settings

# proxy_http_version 1.1;
# Sets HTTP version to 1.1 (required for websockets)
# HTTP/1.0 doesn't support the connection upgrades needed for websockets

# proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
# Passes the Upgrade header from client to n8n
# This header is used to initiate the protocol switch from HTTP to websocket

# proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
# Sets the Connection header to "upgrade"
# Tells n8n that this connection should be upgraded to a websocket


# Why Websockets Are Important for n8n
# n8n uses websockets for:

# Real-time updates during workflow execution
# Live feedback in the editor
# Push notifications about workflow status
# Maintaining session state for the editor

# Without proper websocket support, you'll experience issues like:

# Workflow execution results not showing
# Session errors (like the one you encountered)
# Disconnections from the editor
# Missing real-time updates
# These three websocket-specific directives are essential for the interactive features of the n8n editor to function correctly.
