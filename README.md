# üõ†Ô∏è Project: Secure Remote Environment for Running n8n Automations

## üéØ Objective

Set up a secure, persistent, and scalable environment on a remote server (e.g., Digital Ocean Droplet) to run automation workflows using **n8n**. The project emphasizes best practices in server management, containerization, and security.

---

## üì¶ Project Stages

---

### 1. Provisioning the Remote Server

- Create an account with a cloud provider (e.g., Digital Ocean).
- Generate a local SSH key pair.
- Launch a new Linux-based virtual machine (preferably Ubuntu LTS).
- Configure SSH access using your public key.
- Connect to the server remotely.

---

### 2. Initial Server Hardening

- Create a non-root user with administrative privileges.
- Configure SSH to enhance access security (e.g., disable root login).
- Set up a basic firewall to allow only necessary ports.
- Install a security tool to monitor for suspicious login attempts.

---

### 3. Installing Docker and Docker Compose

- Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose on the server.
- Add your user to the appropriate groups to manage containers.
- Create a dedicated directory structure for the n8n deployment.

---

### 4. Deploying n8n Using Docker Compose

- Define environment variables in a secure `.env` file.
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` to run the n8n container.
- Ensure volumes are properly set for persistent data.
- Start the n8n service and verify it‚Äôs running correctly.
- Temporarily expose the application for testing purposes.

---

### 5. Configuring HTTPS Access

- Register a domain name and point it to your server's IP address.
- Install and configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
- Set up SSL using Let's Encrypt to enable HTTPS access.
- Configure your domain to securely route traffic to the n8n instance.

---

### 6. Implementing Security Best Practices

- Use strong credentials and avoid hardcoding sensitive data.
- Secure n8n with authentication at the application or reverse proxy level.
- Limit network exposure only to trusted services and users.
- Establish a backup strategy for workflow data and environment files.
- Keep your system and containers regularly updated.
